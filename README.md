Task Description:

The task I performed was the design and development of an E-Learning Platform User Interface (UI) using HTML and CSS, with embedded video tutorials from YouTube. The goal of this project was to create a structured, responsive, and visually engaging front-end for an internship assignment, providing learners with a professional dashboard-like experience.

The application is organized into four key sections: Task (Hero), Instructions, Courses, and Video Section.

The Task (Hero) section introduces the project and highlights the internship task title and objective.

The Instructions section provides detailed guidelines regarding the deliverables, ensuring clarity for users or interns working on the task.

The Courses section showcases a grid of course cards, each displaying a title, progress bar, and percentage completion, allowing learners to visually track their progress.

The Video section embeds multiple YouTube tutorials for different topics like HTML & CSS, JavaScript, and React, giving users a direct way to access learning material without leaving the platform.

During development, I first structured the webpage using HTML, ensuring semantic correctness by dividing the layout into header, hero, instructions, courses, video, and footer sections. Next, I styled the platform using CSS, applying consistent colors, typography, card layouts, and hover effects. The progress bars were styled for visual clarity, while responsive video embedding was implemented to ensure smooth playback across devices.

The overall design was made clean, minimal, and user-friendly, ensuring that learners can navigate between sections easily through a sticky navigation bar. This project also demonstrates how multiple resources (text, progress, and videos) can be combined into a cohesive learning interface.

Tools Used:

HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Structured the content into meaningful sections such as navigation, task details, instructions, courses, video embeds, and footer.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styled the platform with modern UI principles including background colors, typography, card layouts, sticky header, shadows, and responsive design for courses and videos.

YouTube Embeds: Integrated external learning resources directly into the platform for interactive video learning.

Git & GitHub (optional): Can be used for version control and deployment of the project for review or collaboration.

Editor/Platform Used:

The project was developed using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for writing and managing the code. The output was tested in Google Chrome to verify correct layout, styling, and video functionality.

Applicability of the Task:

The E-Learning Platform UI can be applied in multiple areas such as:

Education: Designing web-based learning dashboards for schools and online learning systems.

Corporate Training: Providing a clean platform for professional development courses.

Prototyping: A quick demonstration of how an e-learning portal could look and function.

Skill Development: A personal learning tracker with integrated tutorials and progress monitoring.
